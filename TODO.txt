TODO:

Bee bomba, big stationary thing that shoots missiles

robo-moth to fit factory scenes (or maybe moth area variants??)

finish tutorial level1

add more tilesets (factory, bricks, underground, mountains, etc...)

finish save files loading, displaying, etc

extras menu on main menu (concept art?)

give characters clothes? Azzy boxers

opening cutscene, general cutscene textbox logic, skip too

val coin list on map screen

map tile events, conveyor belts, springs

Maybe grapple state for some enemies/bosses

anthro shield enemies, shoot bomba and bullets

cosmetic changes in store? sushi as e-tank?

MANTA RAY ENEMIES/PLATFORMS

boss doors -> for all objects (except the boss), if collision layer is enemy or enemy attack, remove from current scene

bouncy slime blocks, hold jump = higher jump, top and bottom collision

checkpoints that save current coins so far (retry now starts there)

This way, it's fair to have bosses in the same levels as
the rest of the stuff, and surprise mid-world Faie fights
